# Firmware Release Server

A firmware release management service for IOT devices and friends.

Originally developed for use with [Joovv](https://joovv.com/).

## Why?

This makes OTA updates a pleasure. 

Your hardware engineer now has a proper place to upload their releases, 
and your app can determine whether an update is required or not, by making trivial API calls.

## What?

Underneath is an extremely simple django application that allows uploading firmware images using the admin panel

And makes the releases accesbile to devices by simple APIs

`GET http://<domain>/api/latest-after/0.3.5/`

```json
{
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "firmware_bin": "http://<domain>/media/firmware_uploads/1.0.0/firmware_1w0H51u.bin",
    "bootloader_bin": "http://<domain>/media/firmware_uploads/1.0.0/bootloader.bin",
    "partitions_bin": "http://<domain>/media/firmware_uploads/1.0.0/partitions.bin",
    "comments": "fixed the timestamp issues",
    "uploaded_at": "2019-04-25T23:45:16.777279Z"
}
```

`GET http://<domain>/api/latest/` also works.
